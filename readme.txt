== What is RFM? ==

RFM stands for **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a **customer’s behavior** because **frequency** and **monetary** value affect a **customer’s lifetime value**, and **recency** effects **retention**, a measure of **engagement**.

**RFM segmentation helps us in answering these questions:**

* Who are the customers spending the most?
* Who are the most loyal customers coming back and placing a second, third, fourth order?
* Who are the newest customers?
* Who are those customers I am about to lose?
* Who are those customers I've already lost?
